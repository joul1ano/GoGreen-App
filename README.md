# GoGreenApp

This is a simple Android application built using Java in Android Studio. The app encourages recycling by allowing users to scan items, collect points, and redeem them for discount coupons. It uses SQLite for local data storage and is structured using Android Studio activities.

Users are rewarded for recycling actions and can view their progress through statistics displayed in pie charts and bar graphs.
